cast away all the enemies of yesterday
to alleviate all the memories that come our way
there's a better life now you know that i am on your side
your beady eyes burn a hole right through the back of mine
i am out of time

i'm an ordinary man
like everybody else
just a common counterfeit
i'm an ordinary man

hesitate while the world is just a step away
to recreate all the innocence that time can take
i am wide awake

i'm an ordinary man
like everybody else
just a common counterfeit
i'm an ordinary man

i'm an ordinary man
like everybody else
just a common counterfeit
i'm an ordinary man

i live a chemical life
i'm on a mission to try
you went insane for a day
i'll have to shove it away
my only option is gone
smile as they break and they fall
you want a simpler life
you can't erase what was mine

you must be out of your mind
this was a simple design
you fuck it up everytime
how could you leave me behind

it's alright it's alright
'cause i know what you want
but you'll just have to wait
if i had it to give
i would give it away
i'm living it up
while i'm falling from grace
there's no way there's no way that i'm running away

i'm used to making it worse
made up of four letter words
you wanna know what it was
now isolated and gone
you fall apart at the seams
i'll never know what it means
try not to pull it apart
you're aiming straight from the heart

you must be out of your mind
this was a simple design
you fuck it up everytime
how could you leave me behind

it's alright it's alright
'cause i know what you want
but you'll just have to wait
if i had it to give
i would give it away
i'm living it up
while i'm falling from grace
there's no way there's no way that i'm running away

it had to be the worst for me
i don't know what to say so let me be
and now i find you left me behind
i don't know what to say so nevermind

you're mine

it's alright it's alright
'cause i know what you want
but you'll just have to wait
if i had it to give
i would give it away
i'm living it up
while i'm falling from grace
there's no way there's no way that i'm running away

you my friend
you're a lot like them
but i caught your lie
and you know i did
now i'm lost in you
like i always do
and i'd die to win
'cause i'm born to lose

firefly
could you shine your light
now i know your ways
'cause they're just like mine
now i'm justified
as i fall in line
and it's hard to try
when you're open wide

take my hand
we'll be off and then
we'll come back again
to a different land
now i like this way
you can go away
if you guess the name
you cannot replace

firefly
could you shine your light
now i know your ways
'cause they're just like mine
now i'm justified
as i fall in line
and it's hard to try
when you're open wide

bring me your enemies
lay them before me
and walk away

firefly
could you shine your light
now i know your ways
'cause they're just like mine
now i'm justified
as i fall in line
and it's hard to try
when you're open wide

fuck you firefly
have you lost your light
now i hate your ways
'cause they're just like mine
so you lost my friend
such a sorry end
and i don't know why
so i choke and smile
#
i'm losing sight
don't count on me
i chase the sun
it chases me

you know my name
you know my face
you'd know my heart
if you knew my place
i'll walk straight down
as far as i can go

i'll follow you if you follow me
i don't know why you lie so clean
i'll break right through the irony

enlighten me
reveal my fate
just cut these strings
that hold me safe

you know my head
you know my gaze
you'd know my heart
if you knew your place
i'll walk straight down
as far as i can go

i'll follow you if you follow me
i don't know why you lie so clean
i'll break right through the irony

cure this wait
i hate this wait

i'll follow you if you follow me
i don't know why you lie so clean
i'll break right through the irony

breakdown

let the fun and games begin
she is spayed and broken in
skin is cold and white
such a lovely lonely night

heaven is on the way
you could feel the hate
but i guess you never will
i'm on a roll again
and i want an end
'cause i feel you creeping in

what i found in this town
i'm heading for a breakdown
what's that sound you're so loud
i'm heading for a breakdown

drank up all my alcohol
this is not a free for all
i'll be there for you
'til my heart is black and blue

heaven is on the way
you could feel the hate
but i guess you never will
i'm on a roll again
and i want an end
'cause i feel you creeping in

what i found in this town
i'm heading for a breakdown
what's that sound you're so loud
i'm heading for a breakdown

what i found in this town
i'm heading for a breakdown
what's that sound you're so loud
i'm heading for a breakdown

you breakdown you're so proud
i'm heading for a breakdown
what's that sound it's so loud
i'm heading for a breakdown
no

you fought me once but not again
you let me feel your heavy hand
i will clean your fucking mess
and leave no trace of evidence

i am losing you again
let me out and let me in
'cause you're not alone here
not at all
let me belong here
break my fall

shelter me from this again
dedicated to the end
help me break my conscience in
to free us from our innocence

i am losing you again
let me out and let me in
'cause you're not alone here
not at all
let me belong here
break my fall

mayday mayday
requesting permission to land
i cannot control the plane
we are in danger of crashing

i am losing you again
let me out and let me in
'cause you're not alone here
not at all
let me belong here
break my fall

break my fall
break my fall
break my fall
break my fall
break my fall

take a photograph
it'll be the last
not a dollar or a crowd could ever keep me here

i don't have a past
i just have a chance
not a family or honest plea remains to say

rain rain go away
come again another day
all the world is waiting for the sun

is it you i want or just the notion
of a heart to wrap around so i can find my way around

safe to say from here
you're getting closer now
we are never sad 'cause we are not allowed to be

rain rain go away
come again another day
all the world is waiting for the sun

rain rain go away
come again another day
all the world is waiting for the sun

to lie here under you
is all that i could ever do
to lie here under you is all
to lie here under you is all that i could ever do
to lie here under you is all

rain rain go away
come again another day
all the world is waiting for the sun

rain rain go away
come again another day
all the world is waiting for the sun
all the world is waiting for the sun
all the world is waiting for the sun

cold am i
i'm beside myself
because there's no one else
have i grown
so blind
only god could save you
if you knew your way to the light
so fly away
and leave it behind
just stay awake
there's nowhere to hide

i see you
cause you won't get out of my way
i hear you
cause you won't quit screaming my name
i feel you
cause you won't stop touching my skin
i need you
they're coming to take you away

frail and dry
i could lose it all
but i cannot recall
it's all wrong
don't cry
clear away this hate
and we can start to make it alright
so fly away
and leave it behind
return someday
with red in your eyes

i see you
cause you won't get out of my way
i hear you
cause you won't quit screaming my name
i feel you
cause you won't stop touching my skin

i want a normal life
just like a new born child
i am a lover hater
i am an instigator
you are an oversight
don't try to compromise
i'll learn to love to hate it
i am not integrated

just call my name
you'll be okay
your scream is burning through my veins

sooner or later you're gonna hate it
go ahead and throw your life away
driving me under leaving me out there
go ahead and throw your life away

you're like an infantile
i knew it all the while
you sit and try to play me
just like you see on tv
i am an oversight
just like a parasite
why am i so pathetic
i know you won't forget it

just call my name
you'll be okay
your scream is burning through my veins

sooner or later you're gonna hate it
go ahead and throw my life away
driving me under leaving me out there
go ahead and throw my life away

go ahead and throw our life away
driving me under leaving me out there

don't tread the water
just stay still
i'll not be bothered
by you until
i'm picking sides
and pulling the strings
i'm living lies
and shedding the skin
i'm open wide
and letting you in
i'm wronging rights

believe
i don't care what you want
i just want mine
shut up
smart little bitch
i don't need lies
i don't care what you want
i just want mine
get up
force it to fit
confined inside

don't pull me under
into the deep
i often wonder
how it should be
i'm picking sides
and pulling the strings
i'm living lies
and shedding the skin
i'm open wide
and letting you in
i'm wronging rights

believe
i don't care what you want
i just want mine

i don't need lies

it's a crime you let it happen to me
nevermind i'll let it happen to you
out of mind forget it there's nothing to lose
but my mind and all the things i wanted

everytime i get it i throw it away
it's a sign i get it i wanna stay
by the time i lose it i'm not afraid
i'm alive but i can surely fake it

how can i believe when this cloud hangs over me
you're the part of me that i don't wanna see

forget it
forget it
forget it
forget it
forget it
forget it
forget it
forget it
forget it
forget it
forget it

there's a place i see you follow me
just a taste of all that might come to be
i'm alone but holding breath you can breathe
to question every answer counted

just fade away
please let me stay
caught in your way

forget it
forget it
forget it
forget it
forget it
forget it
forget it

just fade away
please let me stay
caught in your way

it's a crime you let it happen to me
out of mind i love it easy to please
nevermind forget it just memories
on a page inside a spiral notebook

just fade away
please let me stay
caught in your way
i can live forever here

forget it

crowded streets are cleared away
one by one
hollow heroes separate
as they run

you're so cold
keep your hand in mine
wise men wonder while strong men die

show me how it ends it's alright
show me how defenseless you really are
satisfied and empty inside
well that's alright let's give this another try

if you find your family don't you cry
in this land of makebelieve dead and dry

you're so cold but you feel alive
lay your hand on me one last time

show me how it ends it's alright
show me how defenseless you really are
satisfied and empty inside
well that's alright let's give this another try

show me how it ends it's alright
show me how defenseless you really are
satisfied and empty inside
well that's alright let's give this another try

what did you say to me
i'm not a novelty
you're playing revelry
but no one's listening
i am a simple man
without a simple plan
let's make this easy
and just get out while we can

i'm the one you want

hey ladybug
you were always on the mind of everyone
ladybug
you're pathetic and i've said it more than once
ladybug
i believe you couldn't reach me where i am
where my feet won't hit the ground

the time is passing by
you're my insecticide
the pressure's on the rise
and i'm right on time
beautiful enemy
i'll fix your broken wings
and let you lie here until
you fly away from me

i'm the one you want

hey ladybug
you were always on the mind of everyone
ladybug
you're pathetic and i've said it more than once
ladybug
i believe you couldn't reach me where i am
where my feet won't hit the ground

what did you say to me
i'm only here to clip your wings
you cut me down to size
i'm only living my life

ladybug
you were always on the mind of everyone
ladybug
you're pathetic and i've said it more than once
ladybug
i believe you couldn't reach me where i am
where my feet won't hit the ground
where my feet won't hit the ground
where my feet won't hit the ground

no named bars
dead end stars
empty roads to nowhere
unlocked cars
life's so far
there's no here to get there

as fast as i run
could you catch me for once
its the last time
i learn my lesson the hard way

because you lost
because i just love to hate you
because you lost me

cold and clean
perfect dream
i don't have or want them
hand me down
white washed town
another boring anthem

as fast as i run
could you catch me for once
its the last time
i learn my lesson the hard way

because you lost
because i just love to hate you
because you lost me

you lost
you lie to me
you lie
you lie to me
you lied
you lie to me

as fast as i run
could you catch me for once
its the last time
i learn my lesson the hard way

because you lost
because i just love to hate you
because you lost me

you lost
because i just love to hate you
because you lost me

they fall in line
one at a time
ready to play
i can't see them anyway
no time to lose
we've got to move
steady your helm
i am losing sight again

fire your guns
it's time to run
blow me away
i will stay in the mess i made
after the fall
we'll shake it off
show me the way

only the strongest will survive
lead me to heaven when we die
i am the shadow on the wall
i'll be the one to save us all

there's nothing left
so save your breath
lying in wait
caught inside this tidal wave
your cover's blown
no where to go
holding your fate
loaded i will walk alone

fire your guns
it's time to run
blow me away
i will stay in the mess i made
after the fall
we'll shake it off
show me the way

only the strongest will survive
lead me to heaven when we die
i am the shadow on the wall
i'll be the one to save us all

you wanted it back
don't make me mad
enough
die

only the strongest will survive
lead me to heaven when we die
i am the shadow on the wall
i'll be the one to save us all

save us all

if i had to
i would put myself right beside you
so let me ask
would you like that
would you like that

and i don't mind
if you say this love is the last time
so now i'll ask
do you like that
do you like that

no

something's getting in the way
something's just about to break
i will try to find my place in the diary of jane
so tell me how it should be

try to find out what makes you tick
as i lie down
sore and sick
do you like that
do you like that

there's a fine line between love and hate
and i don't mind
just let me say that
i like that
i like that

something's getting in the way
something's just about to break
i will try to find my place in the diary of jane
as i burn another page
as i look the other way
i still try to find my place in the diary of jane
so tell me how it should be

desperate i will crawl
waiting for so long
no love there is no love
die for anyone
what have i become

something's getting in the way
something's just about to break
i will try to find my place in the diary of jane
as i burn another page
as i look the other way
i still try to find my place in the diary of jane

hold it together birds of a feather
nothing but lies and crooked wings
i have the answer spreading the cancer
you are the faith inside me

no don't
leave me to die here
help me survive here
alone don't remember remember

put me to sleep evil angel
open your wings evil angel

i'm a believer
nothing could be worse
all these imaginary friends
hiding betrayal
driving the nail
hoping to find a savior

no don't
leave me to die here
help me survive here
alone don't
surrender surrender

put me to sleep evil angel
open your wings evil angel

fly over me evil angel
why can't i breathe evil angel

put me to sleep evil angel
open your wings evil angel

fly over me evil angel
why can't i breathe evil angel

sing it for me
i can't erase the stupid things i say
you're better than me
i struggle just to find a better way

so here we are fighting and trying to hide the scars
i'll be home tonight take a breath and softly say goodbye
the lonely road the one that i should try to walk alone
i'll be home tonight take a breath and softly say goodbye

you wouldn't like me
keep moving on until forever ends
don't try to fight me
the beauty queen has lost her crown again

so here we are fighting and trying to hide the scars
i'll be home tonight take a breath and softly say goodbye
the lonely road the one that i should try to walk alone
i'll be home tonight take a breath and softly say goodbye

so why are you so eager to betray
pick the pieces up pick the pieces up
so why are you the one that walks away
pick the pieces up pick the pieces up pick the pieces up

so here we are fighting and trying to hide the scars
i'll be home tonight take a breath and softly say goodbye
the lonely road the one that i should try to walk alone
i'll be home tonight take a breath and softly say goodbye

just take a breath and softly say goodbye

i see nothing in your eyes and the more i see the less i like
is it over yet in my head
i know nothing of your kind and i won't reveal your evil mind
is it over yet i can't win

so sacrifice yourself and let me have what's left
i know that i can find the fire in your eyes
i'm going all the way get away please

you take the breath right out of me
you left a hole where my heart should be
you got to fight just to make it through
'cause i will be the death of you

this will be all over soon
pour salt into the open wound

is it over yet let me in

so sacrifice yourself and let me have what's left
i know that i can find the fire in your eyes
i'm going all the way get away please

you take the breath right out of me
you left a hole where my heart should be
you got to fight just to make it through
'cause i will be the death of you

i'm waiting i'm praying realize start hating

you take the breath right out of me
you left a hole where my heart should be
you got to fight just to make it through
'cause i will be the death of you

so clever
whatever
i'm done with these endeavors
alone i walk the winding way
here i stay
it's over
no longer
i feel it growing stronger
i'll live to die another day
until i fade away

why give up why give in
it's not enough it never is
so i will go on until the end
we've become desolate
it's not enough it never is
but i will go on until the end

surround me
it's easy
to fall apart completely
i feel you creeping up again
in my head
it's over
no longer
i feel it growing colder
i knew this day would come to end
so let this life begin

why give up why give in
it's not enough it never is
so i will go on until the end
we've become desolate
it's not enough it never is
but i will go on until the end

i've lost my way
i've lost my way but i will go on until the end

living is hard enough
without you fucking up

why give up why give in
it's not enough it never is
so i will go on until the end
we've become desolate
it's not enough it never is
but i will go on until the end

i've lost my way
i've lost my way but i will go on until the end

the final fight i'll win
the final fight i'll win
the final fight i'll win
but i will go on until the end

here i stand helpless and left for dead

close your eyes so many days go by
easy to find what's wrong harder to find what's right

i believe in you i can show you that
i can see right through all your empty lies
i won't stay long in this world so wrong

say goodbye as we dance with the devil tonight
don't you dare look at him in the eye
as we dance with the devil tonight

trembling crawling across my skin
feeling your cold dead eyes stealing the life of mine

i believe in you i can show you that
i can see right through all your empty lies
i won't last long in this world so wrong

say goodbye as we dance with the devil tonight
don't you dare look at him in the eye
as we dance with the devil tonight

hold on hold on

say goodbye as we dance with the devil tonight
don't you dare look at him in the eye
as we dance with the devil tonight

hold on hold on

goodbye

you fight me flat on my lonely face i fell
finding in the end i live well
in light of the life that i have found
it's coming down

i don't know what isn't real
but it's easy
to beat me
suck it in
life is sink or swim
love is blinding no surviving

i don't know what i want to be yet
but i can show that i need to see this
no time for lies and empty fights
i'm on your side

can we live a life of peace and happiness
i don't think so

no denying i am scared to lose the things i love
i'm in control

this is how this is how it's going to end
this is how this is how it's going to end
end

everyone is waiting here for everyone
leave me alone

this is how this is how it's going to end
this is how this is how it's going to end
this is how this is how it's going to end

no

this is how this is how it's going to end

to dream in black and white

search for the answers i knew all along
i lost myself we all fall down
never the wiser of what i've become
alone i stand a broken man

all i have is one last chance
i won't turn my back on you
take my hand drag me down
if you fall then i will too
and i can't save what's left of you

sing something new
i have nothing left
i can't face the dark without you
there's nothing left to lose
the fight never ends
i can't face the dark without you

swallow me under and pull me apart
i understand there's nothing left
pain so familiar and close to the heart
no more no less i won't forget

come back down save yourself
i can't find my way to you
and i can't bear to face the truth

sing something new
i have nothing left
i can't face the dark without you
there's nothing left to lose
the fight never ends
i can't face the dark without you

i wanted to forgive
i'm trying to forget
don't leave me here again
i am with you forever the end

sing something new
i have nothing left
i can't face the dark without you
there's nothing left to lose
the fight never ends
i can't face the dark without you

holding the hand that holds me down
i forgive you forget you the end
holding the hand that holds me down
i forgive you forget you the end

dead star shine
light up the sky
i'm all out of breath
my walls are closing in
days go by
give me a sign
come back to the end
the shepherd of the damned

i can feel you falling away

no longer the lost
no longer the same
and i can see you starting to break
i'll keep you alive
if you show me the way
forever  and ever
the scars will remain
i'm falling apart
leave me here forever in the dark

daylight dies
blackout the sky
does anyone care
is anybody there
take this life
empty inside
i'm already dead
i'll rise to fall again

i can feel you falling away

no longer the lost
no longer the same
and i can see you starting to break
i'll keep you alive
if you show me the way
forever  and ever
the scars will remain
i'm falling apart
leave me here forever in the dark

god help me i've come undone
out of the light of the sun
god help me i've come undone
out of the light of the sun

i can feel you falling away

no longer the lost
no longer the same
and i can see you starting to break
i'll keep you alive
if you show me the way
forever  and ever
the scars will remain

give me a sign
there's something buried in the words
give me a sign
your tears are adding to the flood
just give me a sign
there's something buried in the words
give me a sign
your tears are adding to the flood
just give me a sign
there's something buried in the words
give me a sign
your tears are adding to the flood

forever  and ever
the scars will remain

i am done pretending
you have failed to find what's left
i will suck you dry again
some are not worth saving
you are such a pretty mess
i will choke the life within

now you want to take me down
as if i even care
i am the monster in your head
and i thought you'd learn by now
it seems you haven't yet
i am the venom in your skin
and now your life
is broken

after the lights go out on you
after your worthless life is through
i will remember how you scream
i can't afford to care
i can't afford to care

i am suffocating
you have failed to pull me in
i will drag you down again
life is unrelenting
feeding lies into my head
i will feed the lies you live

now you want to take me down
as if i even care
i am the monster in your head
and i thought you'd learn by now
it seems you haven't yet
i am the venom in your skin
and now your life
is broken

after the lights go out on you
after your worthless life is through
i will remember how you scream
i can't afford to care
i can't afford to care

i can't afford to care
after the lights go out on you
after your worthless life is through
i will remember how you scream
i can't afford to care
i can't afford to care

i can't afford to care

i have nothing left to give
i have found the perfect end
you were made to make it hurt
disappear into the dirt
carry me to heaven's arms
light the way and let me go
take the time to take my breath
i will end where i began

and i will find the enemy within
cause i can feel it crawl beneath my skin

dear agony
just let go of me
suffer slowly
is this the way it's gotta be
dear agony

suddenly
the lights go out
let forever
drag me down
i will fight for one last breath
i will fight until the end

and i will find the enemy within
cause i can feel it crawl beneath my skin

dear agony
just let go of me
suffer slowly
is this the way it's gotta be
don't bury me
faceless enemy
i'm so sorry
is this the way it's gotta be
dear agony

leave me alone
god let me go
i'm blue and cold
black sky will burn
love pull me down
hate lift me up
just turn around
there's nothing left

somewhere far beyond this world
i feel nothing anymore

dear agony
just let go of me
suffer slowly
is this the way it's gotta be
don't bury me
faceless enemy
i'm so sorry
is this the way it's gotta be
dear agony

i feel nothing anymore
#
take a breath
hold it in
start a fight
you won't win
had enough
let's begin
nevermind
i don't care

all in all
you're no good
you don't cry
like you should
let it go
if you could
when love dies in the end

so i'll find what lies beneath
your sick twisted smile
as i lie underneath
your cold jaded eyes
now you turn the tide on me
'cause you're so unkind
i will always be here
for the rest of my life

here we go
does it hurt
say goodbye
to this world
i will not
be undone
come to life
it gets worse

all in all
you're no good
you don't cry
like you should
i'll be gone
when you fall
your sad life
says it all

so i'll find what lies beneath
your sick twisted smile
as i lie underneath
your cold jaded eyes
now you turn the tide on me
'cause you're so unkind
i will always be here
for the rest of my life

don't carry me under
you're the devil in disguise
god sing for the hopeless
i'm the one you left behind

so i'll find what lies beneath
your sick twisted smile
as i lie underneath
your cold jaded eyes
now you turn the tide on me
'cause you're so unkind
i will always be here
for the rest of my life

white walls surround us
no light will touch your face again
rain taps the window
as we sleep among the dead

days go on forever
but i have not left your side
we can chase the dark together
if you go then so will i

there is nothing left of you
i can see it in your eyes
sing the anthem of the angels
and say the last goodbye

cold light above us
hope fills the heart
and fades away
skin white as winter
as the sky returns to grey

days go on forever
but i have not left your side
we can chase the dark together
if you go then so will i

there is nothing left of you
i can see it in your eyes
sing the anthem of the angels
and say the last goodbye
i keep holding onto you
but i can't bring you back to life
sing the anthem of the angels
then say the last goodbye

you're dead alive
you're dead alive
you're dead alive
you're dead alive

there is nothing left of you
i can see it in your eyes
sing the anthem of the angels
and say the last goodbye
i keep holding onto you
but i can't bring you back to life
sing the anthem of the angels
and say the last goodbye
sing the anthem of the angels
and say the last goodbye
sing the anthem of the angels

i'm cold and broken
it's over i didn't want to see it come to this
i wonder if i will ever see your face again
and i know that i will find a way to shed my skin
it's simple i know that i will suffer in the end

fast i fade away
it's almost over
hold on
slow i suffocate
i'm cold and broken
alone

it's hopeless the end will come and wash it all away
forsaken i live for those i lost along the way
and i can't remember how it all began to break
you suffer i live to fight and die another day

fast i fade away
it's almost over
hold on
slow i suffocate
i'm cold and broken
alone

fast i fade away
it's almost over
hold on
slow i suffocate
i'm cold and broken
alone

i'm cold and broken
#
the shadow of a man
i'm nothing less
i am holding on still holding on
and every now and then life begins again
i am holding on still holding on
i'm not like you

your faceless lies
your weak dead heart
your black dead eyes

i'll make it through but not this time
your hope is gone and so is mine

live fight
crawl back inside
sick blind
love left behind
and i won't live your weak wicked lie
you pull me in i'm one step behind

show me where it hurts
and i'll make it worse
are you holding on keep holding on
dilated eyes shine for one last time
are you holding on keep holding on
you're not like me

your faceless lies
your weak dead heart
your black dead eyes

i'll break you in and let this die
your hope is gone
and so is mine

live fight
crawl back inside
sick blind
love left behind
and i won't live your weak wicked lie
you pull me in i'm one step behind

i'm becoming a monster just like you
after it all you'll try to break me too
falling forever chasing dreams
i brought you to life so i can hear you scream

live fight
crawl back inside
sick blind
love left behind
and i won't live your weak wicked lie
you pull me in i'm one step behind

i'm one step behind
i'm one step behind
#
screaming on the inside
i am frail and withered
cover up the wounds
that i can't hide
walls that lie between us
the saint within the sinner
i have lost the nerve
but it's all right
carry the wounded and shut your eyes
all will be forgiven
none will rise
bury the fallen and lead the blind
i will find the lost
dead inside

into the nothing
faded and weary
i won't leave and let you fall behind
live for the dying
heaven hear me
i know we can make it out alive

leave me at the bottom
i am lost forever
letters from the dead
say goodbye
sorrow falls upon us
this will be the last time
days begin to end
but i'll get by
follow the hopeless
and shut your eyes

all will be abandoned
none will shine
gather the broken and leave this life
lying in the earth
side by side

into the nothing
faded and weary
i won't leave and let you fall behind
live for the dying
heaven hear me
i know we can make it out alive

i'll keep you inside
where i lead you cannot follow
straight into the light
as my breath grows still and shallow

into the nothing
faded and weary
i won't leave and let you fall behind
live for the dying
heaven hear me
i know we can make it out alive

stay with me
you're all i have left
i know we can make it out alive
stay with me
you're all i have left
i know we can make it out alive
#
here i lie forever
sorrow still remains
will the water pull me down and wash it all away
come and take me over
welcome to the game
will the current drag me down and carry me away
suddenly the light begins to fade

hopeless
i'm falling down
filthy
i can't wake up
i can not hold on
i will not let go
worthless
it's over now
guilty
there's no way out
i can not hold on
i will not let go

silent i go under
i am not afraid
i can see the daylight shine
and slowly drift away
safe to say it's over
sink into the grave
there is nothing left inside
but i am wide awake
i can hear the devil call my name

hopeless
i'm falling down
filthy
i can't wake up
i can not hold on
i will not let go
worthless
it's over now
guilty
there's no way out
i can not hold on
i will not let go
#
fall

now the dark begins to rise
save your breath it's far from over
leave the lost and dead behind
now's your chance to run for cover

i don't want to change the world
i just wanna leave it colder
light the fuse and burn it up
take the path that leads to nowhere

all is lost again
but i'm not giving in

i will not bow
i will not break
i will shut the world away
i will not fall
i will not fade
i will take your breath away

fall

watch the end through dying eyes
now the dark is taking over
show me where forever dies
take the fall and run to heaven

all is lost again
but i'm not giving in

i will not bow
i will not break
i will shut the world away
i will not fall
i will not fade
i will take your breath away

and i'll survive paranoid
i have lost the will to change
and i am not proud coldblooded fake
i will shut the world away

open your eyes

i will not bow
i will not break
i will shut the world away
i will not fall
i will not fade
i will take your breath away

and i'll survive paranoid
i have lost the will to change
and i am not proud coldblooded fake
i will shut the world away

fall

i feel you coming slow
it seems that's all you know
you come around never lie
you sense it's all in line
deadened by the way you overwhelm
saved by the ways
dead and bothered by the breaking down
leave you all i have
you might shove me down
you will never be alone
you can lock me out
you will never be alone
you can shove me down
you will never be alone
i don't know what you think
you chose the silent way
you look around you see
it's just like all i believe
bothered by the part we end
you will never leave again
i'm a better part of you
dead if i can't make it out
you might shove me down
you will never be alone
you can lock me out
you will never be alone
you can shove me down
you will never be alone
your fucking way
bothered by the part we end
you will never leave again
i'm a better part of you
it's all upon the end
you can shove me down
you will never be alone
you can lock me out
you will never be alone
you can shove me down
you will never be alone
you can lock me out
you will never be alone
#
you carry me places i'd rather be
well mannered gardens well tempered seas
we're gathered in reason i should believe
that this is different that this isn't free
how could this be

i'm on my way to better days
i'll find my faith i'll find a way
i'm on my way to better days
i'll find my faith

i will slip again and you'll find me
i will live again and you'll find me
run but carry the meanings of your past

i'm on my way to better days
you'll find your faith you'll find a way
you're on your way to better days
you'll find your faith

i'm on our way to better days
we'll find our faith we'll find a way

we're on our way to better days
we'll find our faith we'll find a way
we're on our way to betters days
we'll find our faith

i'm on my way
i'm on my way to better days
i'll find my way
we'll find our faith
find our faith

find our way

when all these dreams have come to end
you wish you were you're not my friend

i can find no other way
try to make you saturate
i can be your enemy
why should i have to wait
i'll just look the other way

when all these dreams have come to end
you wish you were you're not my friend

the long hard road
that i have been
when all these dreams have come to end
you wish you were you're not my friend

this painless thrill
it's bitter still
your pretty pill
you wait until
you've had your fill
i know you will

the light is dead in your eye
so i'll keep living my life
i only wanted to try
to find my way back inside
my imitation of life
my litigation of life
it's something easy to find
inside the shade of your eye

out of the ground i rise to grace
nobody knows it's just a phase
help me i'm out of breath again
nobody knows somewhere to make it go away

phase
phase
phase
phase

i find it hard to decide
the way to make up your mind
your lips are better than mine
so you can kiss this goodbye
my imitation of life
my litigation of life
it's something easy to find
inside the shade of your eye

out of the ground i rise to grace
nobody knows it's just a phase
help me i'm out of breath again
nobody knows somewhere to make it go away

it's just a phase
and i can't wait
phase
phase
phase
i know
i know
i know
it's just a fucking phase

watch the penny drop
let it go up and in drop
then watch it roll
let's all mourn till
i survive inside you

i got somethin' up my sleeve
i know you will cover me
inside out and in between

run away
make hate

i've got a little red bow
and i bought it for you
'cause i know you're not fair
i don't get it oh well
and you color my skin
and the colors don't blend
'cause i'm gonna get you
and your little dog too
there's a yellow brick road
that we follow back home
'cause i know you can't wait
your belligerent hate
there's no place like home
there's no place like home
like home
i've got a southern belle too
and ruby red shoes
with a body of straw
are you sick of it all
there's a man made of tin
with an oil can grin
and i'm gonna get you
and your little dog too
there's a yellow brick road
that we follow back home
and i know you can't wait
your belligerent hate
there's no place like home
there's no place like home
there's a little white porch
and you wanted it so
can you let me go down
to the end of the road
in the black and the white
a technicolorful life
can i stand by your side
we can make it alright
like home
'cause i'm home
there's a little white porch
and you wanted it so
can you let me go down
to the end of the road
in the black and the white
a technicolorful life
then another arrived
it's a cowardly lion
what i want from this world
what i wanna resolve
when i want you to stay
so i want you to wait
i don't wanna be bold
i don't wanna be cold
i don't wanna grow old
i don't wanna go home

i've felatted myself

tied to the needle
my drunk libido
my nervous ego
the faster we go
you are an asshole
king of the castle
i am the meager
follow the leader

would you want to
feel the way that i do
and i bend to your will
i've felatted myself

and i know that you don't
like the way that it goes
we're all in so begin

i'd say your worst side's your best side
i never hurt anyone
i never listen at all

well how do you know
well how do you know
well how do you know
well how do you know

will the faithful be rewarded
when we come to the end
will i miss the final warning
from the lie that i have lived

i can see the soul within
and i am not worthy
i am not worthy of this

are you with me after all
why can't i hear you
are you with me through it all
then why can't i feel you

stay with me don't let me go
because there's nothing left at all
stay with me don't let me go
until the ashes of eden fall

will the darkness fall upon me
when the air is growing thin
will the light begin to pull me
to its everlasting will
i can hear the voices haunting
there is nothing left to fear
and i am still calling
i am still calling to you

are you with me after all
why can't i hear you
are you with me through it all
then why can't i feel you

stay with me don't let me go
because there's nothing left at all
stay with me don't let me go
until the ashes of eden fall

don't let go

why can't i hear you
stay with me don't let me go
because there's nothing left at all
stay with me don't let me go
until the ashes of eden fall

heaven above me take my hand
shine until there's nothing left but you
heaven above me take my hand
shine until there's nothing left but you

i keep falling out of line
i was drained and left behind
all will fade and petrify
feed the hate and starve the lies

falling in between
i am caught beneath

light the way and let me go
suffocate inside
i will break and watch you crawl
bury me alive

i keep falling out of time
i was blamed and cauterized
all will change and calcify
feed the hate and starve the lies

falling in between
i am caught beneath

light the way and let me go
suffocate inside
i will break and watch you crawl
bury me alive

control

lies inside
lies inside

light the way and let me go
suffocate inside
i will break and watch you crawl
bury me alive

light the way and let me go
suffocate inside
i will break and watch you crawl
bury me alive
bury me alive
bury me alive

pain
come alive
i try to breathe shade my eyes
follow the damned i have lost the way again

stay
trust in life carried beneath dead arise
sorrow avenged i will face the weak within

so i'll stay unforgiven
and i'll keep love together
and i'll be yours forever
i'll sleep close to heaven

hate lost inside
i dare to dream faithless lies
caught in the web i will face the weak within

so i'll stay unforgiven
and i'll keep love together
and i'll be yours forever
i'll sleep close to heaven

i'm coming home
i'm coming home
i'm coming home
release me my love

so i'll stay unforgiven
and i'll keep love together
and i'll be yours forever
i'll sleep close to heaven

i'll sleep close to heaven
i'll sleep close to heaven
#
stay alive
heaven holds a place for us tonight
i am paralyzed

close your eyes
drive away the cloud that hides the light
and leave the pain behind
dead alive
find a way to bury all the lies
escape the pain inside
'cause i don't want to fall or let you go

love left me hollow
i'm with you in the end
cold crippled and shallow
don't leave me here again

fruit of life
i can hear the voices of the hive
chemicals collide
loaded smile
light the way for those you left behind
set the earth on fire
'cause i don't want enough
i want it all

love left me hollow
i'm with you in the end
cold crippled and shallow
don't leave me here again
i can't go on
you are bound to break me in
i come undone
as you drag me down again

i come undone

love left me hollow
i'm with you in the end
cold crippled and shallow
don't leave me here again
i can't go on
you are bound to break me in
i come undone
as you drag me down again
#
carry me under leave me abandoned
show me what's left show me what's left
beautiful anger breaking the pattern
show me what's left show me what's left

take the color from your eyes
i bleed for you i bleed for you
bring the broken back to life
we'll make it through we'll make it through

empty and perfect shattered and worthless
show me what's left show me what's left
dragging me further forget to remember
show me what's left show me what's left

take the color from your eyes
i bleed for you i bleed for you
bring the broken back to life
we'll make it through we'll make it through

never again never again
time will not take the life from me
never again never again
time will not take the life from me

and after this world is out of reach
sober and silent faded and violent
hopeless i fight to fall between
never surrender out of the embers
save a space inside for me

take the color from your eyes
i bleed for you i bleed for you
bring the broken back to life
we'll make it through we'll make it through

never again never again
time will not take the life from me
never again never again
time will not take the life from me
#
i try to face the fight within
but it's over
i'm ready for the riot to begin
and surrender
i walked the path that led me to the end
remember
i'm caught beneath with nothing left to give
forever

when angels fall with broken wings
i can't give up i can't give in
when all is lost and daylight ends
i'll carry you and we will live forever forever

grey skies will chase the light away
no longer
i fought the fight now only dark remains
forever
divided i will stand
and i will let this end

when angels fall with broken wings
i can't give up i can't give in
when all is lost and daylight ends
i'll carry you and we will live forever forever

the sun begins to rise
and wash away the sky
the turning of the tide
don't leave it all behind
and i will never say goodbye

when angels fall with broken wings
i can't give up i can't give in
when all is lost and daylight ends
i'll carry you and we will live forever forever
forever forever

life will come our way
it has only just begun
the world will die alone
the frail will fall below

time will take our place
we return it back to one
the calm before the cold
the long and lonely road

look for the light that leads me home

tired of feeling lost tired of letting go
tear the whole world down tear the whole world down
failure

drive the cloud away
we will fall from last to none
the dark before the dawn
the world will carry on

look for the light that leads me home

tired of feeling lost tired of letting go
tear the whole world down tear the whole world down
tired of wasted breath tired of nothing left
tear the whole world down tear the whole world down
failure

tired of feeling lost tired of letting go
tear the whole world down tear the whole world down
tired of wasted breath tired of nothing left
tear the whole world down tear the whole world down

we bury the sunlight we bury the sunlight
failure failure
we bury the sunlight we bury the sunlight
failure failure

failure

i'll keep my sights on awaking dream
i gave my life to the vile beneath
i am but one of a dying breed
hate kills this world but it won't kill me

wake up the victim of violence shut the breath of the lifeless
i'm breaking the silence i'm falling apart for you
wake up the victim of violence shut the breath of the lifeless
i'm chasing the righteous becoming a part of you

fake plastic life full of wasted years
love lost inside diabolic fear
i feel no fault for the fault i feel
hope drains this world but it won't drain me

wake up the victim of violence shut the breath of the lifeless
i'm breaking the silence i'm falling apart for you
wake up the victim of violence shut the breath of the lifeless
i'm chasing the righteous becoming a part of you

run

wake up the victim of violence shut the breath of the lifeless
i'm breaking the silence i'm falling apart for you
wake up the victim of violence shut the breath of the lifeless
i'm chasing the righteous becoming a part of you

i'm breaking the silence i'm falling down with you

slip away your vanity is gone
i'm falling out of place
we all fall down the pain goes on
we bare the fruit of war
and turn the lost away
we all fall down the pain goes on
and i'll be the fire that dries the flood

as i fight for one last prayer
i keep holding on
no love to believe in
as i drag the devil down
i will stand alone
no longer defeated

stripped away we rise above it all
forgotten and betrayed
we all fall down the pain goes on
no better than before
still broken and afraid
we all fall down the pain goes on
and i'll be the cloud that hides the sun

as i fight for one last prayer
i keep holding on
no love to believe in
as i drag the devil down
i will stand alone
no longer defeated

i'm falling to pieces
stained and used
i know what i need and it's not you
it's not you

as i fight for one last prayer
i keep holding on
no love to believe in
as i drag the devil down
i will stand alone
no longer defeated
no longer defeated
no longer defeated
#
carry me all through the night
i am the last light fading
leave all the lost souls behind
show me the silence breaking
and when you're lost and out of time
i will be right here waiting
and when your dreams return to life
i'll be forever fading
and we'll fall behind

so i'll wait for you
as i keep your faith alive
and i'll pray for you
as we cross the great divide

bury the wounds deep inside
rupture the fault line breaking
dream of the world left behind
show us we're worth forsaking
and when the cold begins to rise
darkness is overtaking
and when the fear is satisfied
i'll be forever changing
as we all arise

so i'll wait for you
as i keep your faith alive
and i'll pray for you
as we cross the great divide
and i'll break for you
as i open up the sky
and i'll stay for you
as we cross the great divide

follow the sunlight down
cry clear and loud
heaven won't help us now
but it's better this way
warm light wash me away

so i'll wait for you
as i keep your faith alive
and i'll pray for you
as we cross the great divide
and i'll break for you
as i open up the sky
and i'll stay for you
as we cross the great divide

days reborn
fight with folded hands
pain left below
the lifeless live again

run run run
red cold river
run run run
red cold river

i can't feel anything at all
this life has left me cold and damned
i can't feel anything at all
this love has led me to the end

stay reformed
erase this perfect world
hate left below
the dark stray dog of war

run run run
red cold river
i can't feel anything at all
this life has left me cold and damned
i can't feel anything at all
this love has led me to the end
run run run
red cold river

try to find a reason to live
try to find a reason to live
try to find a reason to live

i can't feel anything at all
this life has left me cold and damned
i can't feel anything at all
this love has let me to the end
run run run
red cold river
