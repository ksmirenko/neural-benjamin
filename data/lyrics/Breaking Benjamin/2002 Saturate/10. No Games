This game is over
I'm mean and older
You're coming closer
Over and over
My dear Brianna
I need an answer
What was the question?
I can't remember

Would you, want to
Feel the way that I do?
And I bend, to your will
I've felatted myself

Tied to the needle
My drunk libido
My nervous ego
The faster we go
You are an asshole
King of the castle
I am the meager
Follow the leader

Would you, want to
Feel the way that I do?
And I bend, to your will
I've felatted myself

And I know that you don't
Like the way that it goes
We're all in, so begin
Just remember: I win
