It started again
Claimin' a friend
I couldn't be
I've never been
I'm all alone
Out in the cold
I'll never know
Your sugarcoat
You're ready to blow
You're ready to go
But I'll never know
Your sugarcoat
Is just as sweet as I am

Look what you did
Suck on your lies 'til your eyes turn red
What did you say
Willing to drown in a tidal wave
Take me away
Let me believe that you're on your way
Look what you did
Suck on your lies 'til your eyes turn red

I'm on the floor
Battered and bored
You got a taste
I can't ignore
I'm all alone
Out in the cold
I'll never know
Your sugarcoat
You're ready to blow
You're ready to go
But I'll never know
Your sugarcoat
Is just as sweet as I am

Look what you did
Suck on your lies 'til your eyes turn red
What did you say
Willing to drown in a tidal wave
Take me away
Let me believe that you're on your way
Look what you did
Suck on your lies 'til your eyes turn red

Look what you did
Suck on your lies 'til your eyes turn red
What did you say
Willing to drown in a tidal wave
Take me away
Let me believe that you're on your way
Look what you did
Suck on your lies 'til your eyes turn red

Red
Your eyes are red
