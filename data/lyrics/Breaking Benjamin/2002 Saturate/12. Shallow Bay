come on
the sun will rise
another time
the colors blind
your virgin eyes
I'm so inclined
to make you mine
you're out of line
and out of time

and I float upon a shallow bay
lift me up until the ground gives way
I'm a California castaway
I don't think you wanna fuck with me

don't over kill
this painless thrill
it's bitter still
your pretty pill
you wait until
you've had your fill
I know you will
I know you will

and I float upon a shallow bay
lift me up until the ground gives way
I'm a California castaway
I don't think you wanna fuck with me

a shallow bay
a shallow bay

and I float upon a shallow bay
lift me up until the ground gives way
I'm a California castaway
I don't think you wanna fuck with me

and I float upon a shallow bay
lift me up until the ground gives way
I'm a California castaway
I don't think you wanna fuck with me

you live, you learn
you live, you learn
you live, you learn
you live
