I got somethin' up my sleeve
I know you will cover me
Inside out and in between
I know you will cover me
I've got bruises on my knees
I know you will cover me
Inside out and in between
And I know you will cover me

Run away
Make hate
And get laid
And get laid
You tie me up
I've had enough
So medicate
Medicate

I'm already incomplete
I know you will cover me
Looking by your empathy
I know you will cover me
I've been lyin' here for weeks
I know you will cover me
Inside out and in between
And I know you will cover me

Run away
Make hate
And get laid
And get laid
You tie me up
I've had enough
So medicate
Medicate

Run away
Make hate
And get laid
And get laid
You tie me up
I've had enough
So medicate
Medicate

Run away
Make hate
And get laid
And get laid
You tie me up
I've had enough
So medicate
Medicate
