Well I know you don't know the reason
And it's cold, a sign of the season
'cause you're old, and battered and beaten
And we'll grow, til we hit the ceiling, yeah

Well I'll be better, get away
Send a letter, bombs away

You're covered in my skin
I couldn't imagine anyone else
I'm off for the weekend
I couldn't imagine why you would save yourself

Well it's gone and it's not returning
And your clothes and pictures are burning
'cause you're old, and battered and beaten
And we'll grow, til we hit the ceiling, yeah

Well I'll be better, get away
Send a letter, bombs away

You're covered in my skin
I couldn't imagine anyone else
I'm off for the weekend
I couldn't imagine why you would save yourself

Well I'll be better, get away
Send a letter, bombs away

You're covered in my skin
I couldn't imagine anyone else
I'm off for the weekend
I couldn't imagine why you would save yourself

I couldn't imagine
Why you would save yourself
