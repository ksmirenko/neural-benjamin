hold still
all of my life
all of my time
I don't wanna come back around tonight
and all that I need
is serenity
I don't wanna feel your new disease

the natural life
you're born, you die
the natural life
you're wrong, you're right
the natural life
you're born, you die
the natural life's a lie

all of my lies
swallow your pride
I don't wanna come back around tonight
and all that I need
is serenity
I don't wanna feel your new disease

the natural life
you're born, you die
the natural life
you're wrong, you're right
the natural life
you're born, you die
the natural life's a lie

right
you're right
I can never lie
let me go
try to find a home
I can't wait
try to stay awake
dead inside
bothered by the lie
you're right

the natural life
you're born, you die
the natural life
you're wrong, you're right
the natural life
you're born, you die
the natural life's a lie

a lie
