beneath this wave
I just can't take your breath away
you cut me down
you know I'll always be around
so now I wait
I know you'll live another day
come and take my breath away
look me straight in the face

cause you know it's over
growin' colder
I need something
leave me next to nothing
all we ever wanted
I need something
leave me next to nothing
next to nothing

I cut you down
I know you'll always be around
so now you'll wait
I know you'll live another day
come and take my breath away
look me straight in the face

cause you know it's over
growin' colder
I need something
leave me next to nothing
all we ever wanted
I need something
leave me next to nothing
next to nothing

cause you know it's over
growin' colder
I need something
leave me next to nothing
all we ever wanted
I need something
leave me next to nothing
next to nothing
