what's all this talk of a notion?
I'd rather drink from the ocean
what did you mean when you said no?
I only want what is best for you
but I won't ever let you drown
no I won't ever let you down

cause I am my enemy
the water's up to the knee
I never wanted nothin' from you
yes I do, yes I do
my engine's runnin' on dry
my head's so fucked up inside
shut up
I know
I said so

there is no way to recover
you told me there is no other
the surface is getting hotter
I'll shove your head under water
but I won't ever let you drown
no I won't ever let you down

cause I am my enemy
the water's up to the knee
I never wanted nothin' from you
yes I do, yes I do
my engine's runnin' on dry
my head's so fucked up inside
shut up
I know
I said so

cause I am my enemy
the water's up to the knee
I never wanted nothin' from you
yes I do, yes I do
my engine's runnin' on dry
my head's so fucked up inside
shut up
I know
I said so

cause I am my enemy
the water's up to the knee
I never wanted nothin' from you
yes I do, yes I do
my engine's runnin' on dry
my head's so fucked up inside
shut up
I know
I said so
