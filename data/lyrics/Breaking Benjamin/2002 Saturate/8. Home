I've got a little red bow
And I bought it for you
'cause I know you're not fair
I don't get it, oh well
And you color my skin
And the colors don't blend
'cause I'm gonna get you
And your little dog too
There's a yellow brick road
That we follow back home
'cause I know you can't wait
Your belligerent hate
There's no place like home
There's no place like home
Like home
I've, got a southern belle too
And ruby red shoes
With a body of straw
Are you sick of it all?
There's a man made of tin
With an oil can grin
And I'm gonna get you
And your little dog too
There's a yellow brick road
That we follow back home
And I know you can't wait
Your belligerent hate
There's no place like home
There's no place like home
There's a little white porch
And you wanted it so
Can you let me go down
To the end of the road
In the black and the white
A Technicolorful life
Can I stand by your side?
We can make it alright
Like home
'cause I'm home
There's a little white porch
And you wanted it so
Can you let me go down
To the end of the road
In the black and the white
A Technicolorful life
Then another arrived
It's a cowardly lion
What I want from this world
What I wanna resolve
When I want you to stay
So I want you to wait
I don't wanna be bold
I don't wanna be cold
I don't wanna grow old
I don't wanna go home
