The light is dead in your eye
So I'll keep living my life
I only wanted to try
To find my way back inside
My imitation of life
My litigation of life
It's something easy to find
Inside the shade of your eye

Out of the ground I rise to grace
Nobody knows it's just a phase
Help me I'm out of breath again
Nobody knows somewhere to make it go away

Phase
Phase
Phase
Phase

I find it hard to decide
The way to make up your mind
Your lips are better than mine
So you can kiss this goodbye
My imitation of life
My litigation of life
It's something easy to find
Inside the shade of your eye

Out of the ground I rise to grace
Nobody knows it's just a phase
Help me I'm out of breath again
Nobody knows somewhere to make it go away

It's just a phase
And I can't wait
Phase
Phase
Phase
I know
I know
I know
It's just a fucking phase

It's just a fucking phase
I'm drained time to fake and delay
Watch the penny drop
Let it go up and in drop
Then watch it roll
Let's all mourn till
I survive inside you
