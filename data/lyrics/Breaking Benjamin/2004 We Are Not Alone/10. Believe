Don't tread the water
Just stay still
I'll not be bothered
By you until
I'm picking sides
And pulling the strings
I'm living lies
And shedding the skin
I'm open wide
And letting you in
I'm wronging rights

Believe
I don't care what you want
I just want mine
Shut up
Smart little bitch
I don't need lies
I don't care what you want
I just want mine
Get up
Force it to fit
Confined inside

Don't pull me under
Into the deep
I often wonder
How it should be
I'm picking sides
And pulling the strings
I'm living lies
And shedding the skin
I'm open wide
And letting you in
I'm wronging rights

Believe
I don't care what you want
I just want mine
Shut up
Smart little bitch
I don't need lies
I don't care what you want
I just want mine
Get up
Force it to fit
Confined inside

I don't care what you want
I just want mine
I don't care what you want
I just want mine
Shut up
Smart little bitch
I don't need lies
I don't care what you want
I just want mine
Get up
Force it to fit
Confined inside
My dead eyes
