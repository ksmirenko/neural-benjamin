Cast away all the enemies of yesterday
To alleviate all the memories that come our way
There's a better life now you know that I am on your side
Your beady eyes burn a hole right through the back of mine
I am out of time

I'm an ordinary man
Like everybody else
Just a common counterfeit
I'm an ordinary man

Hesitate while the world is just a step away
To recreate all the innocence that time can take
I am wide awake

I'm an ordinary man
Like everybody else
Just a common counterfeit
I'm an ordinary man

I'm an ordinary man
Like everybody else
Just a common counterfeit
I'm an ordinary man
