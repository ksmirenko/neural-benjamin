What did you say to me
I'm not a novelty
You're playing revelry
But no one's listening
I am a simple man
Without a simple plan
Let's make this easy
And just get out while we can

I'm the one you want

Hey Ladybug
You were always on the mind of everyone
Ladybug
You're pathetic and I've said it more than once
Ladybug
I believe you couldn't reach me where I am
Where my feet won't hit the ground

The time is passing by
You're my insecticide
The pressure's on the rise
And I'm right on time
Beautiful enemy
I'll fix your broken wings
And let you lie here until
You fly away from me

I'm the one you want

Hey Ladybug
You were always on the mind of everyone
Ladybug
You're pathetic and I've said it more than once
Ladybug
I believe you couldn't reach me where I am
Where my feet won't hit the ground

What did you say to me
I'm only here to clip your wings
You cut me down to size
I'm only living my life

Ladybug
You were always on the mind of everyone
Ladybug
You're pathetic and I've said it more than once
Ladybug
I believe you couldn't reach me where I am
Where my feet won't hit the ground
Where my feet won't hit the ground
Where my feet won't hit the ground
Where my feet won't hit the ground
