I live a chemical life
I'm on a mission to try
You went insane for a day
I'll have to shove it away
My only option is gone
Smile as they break and they fall
You want a simpler life
You can't erase what was mine

You must be out of your mind!
This was a simple design!
You fuck it up everytime
How could you leave me behind

It's alright, it's alright
'cause I know what you want
but you'll just have to wait
If I had it to give
I would give it away
I'm living it up
while I'm falling from grace
There's no way, there's no way that I'm running away

I'm used to making it worse
Made up of four letter words
You wanna know what it was
Now isolated and gone
You fall apart at the seams
I'll never know what it means
Try not to pull it apart
You're aiming straight from the heart

You must be out of your mind!
This was a simple design!
You fuck it up everytime
How could you leave me behind

It's alright, it's alright
'cause I know what you want
but you'll just have to wait
If I had it to give
I would give it away
I'm living it up
while I'm falling from grace
There's no way, there's no way that I'm running away

It had to be the worst for me
I don't know what to say so let me be
And now I find you left me behind
I don't know what to say so nevermind!

You're mine!

It's alright, it's alright
'cause I know what you want
but you'll just have to wait
If I had it to give
I would give it away
I'm living it up
while I'm falling from grace
There's no way, there's no way that I'm running away
