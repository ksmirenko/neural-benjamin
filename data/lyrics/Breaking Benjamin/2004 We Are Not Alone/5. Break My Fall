You fought me once but not again
You let me feel your heavy hand
I will clean your fucking mess
And leave no trace of evidence

I am losing you again
Let me out and let me in
'cause you're not alone here
Not at all
Let me belong here
Break my fall

Shelter me from this again
Dedicated to the end
Help me break my conscience in
To free us from our innocence

I am losing you again
Let me out and let me in
'cause you're not alone here
Not at all
Let me belong here
Break my fall

Mayday, Mayday.
Requesting permission to land.
I cannot control the plane.
We are in danger of crashing

I am losing you again
Let me out and let me in
'cause you're not alone here
Not at all
Let me belong here
Break my fall

Break my fall
Break my fall
Break my fall
Break my fall
Break my fall
