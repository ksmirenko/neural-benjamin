My hands are broken,
And time is going on and on, it goes forever (how long).
So I got high and lived all that life that I've taken all for granted.

Promise me you'll try
To leave it all behind,
'cause I've elected hell,
Lying to myself.
Why have I gone blind?
Live another life.

You. You.

The only way out
Is letting your guard down and never die forgotten (I know).
Forgive me, my love,
I stand here all alone, and I can see the bottom.

Promise me you'll try
To leave it all behind,
'cause I've elected hell,
Lying to myself.
Why have I gone blind?
Live another life.

You. You.
You. You.
You. You.
