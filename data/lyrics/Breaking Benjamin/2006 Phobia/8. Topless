Fruit on the vine.
You've got yours,
And I've got mine.
Meat on your bones.
They won't know, they won't know.

I love your face, just get away.
I'm on my knees, fuck you, fuck me.

I'm on my way to feel you dislocate.
Safe in your space.
I'm open, wide open.

I love your face, just get away.
I'm on my knees, fuck you, fuck me.

Like me, like me, like me.

I love your face, just get away.
I'm on my knees, fuck you, fuck me.

Me, me, me.
