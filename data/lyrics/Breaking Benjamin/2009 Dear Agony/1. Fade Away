I'm cold and broken
It's over I didn't want to see it come to this
I wonder if I will ever see your face again
And I know that I will find a way to shed my skin
It's simple I know that I will suffer in the end

Fast I fade away
It's almost over
Hold on
Slow I suffocate
I'm cold and broken
Alone

It's hopeless, the end will come and wash it all away
Forsaken, I live for those I lost along the way
And I can't remember how it all began to break
You suffer, I live to fight and die another day

Fast I fade away
It's almost over
Hold on
Slow I suffocate
I'm cold and broken
Alone

Fast I fade away
It's almost over
Hold on
Slow I suffocate
I'm cold and broken
Alone

I'm cold and broken
