The shadow of a man
I'm nothing less
I am holding on, still holding on
And every now and then life begins again
I am holding on, still holding on
I'm not like you

Your faceless lies
Your weak dead heart
Your black dead eyes

I'll make it through, but not this time
Your hope is gone, and so is mine

Live, fight
Crawl back inside
Sick, blind
Love left behind
And I won't live, your weak wicked lie
You pull me in, I'm one step behind

Show me where it hurts
And I'll make it worse
Are you holding on? Keep holding on
Dilated eyes shine for one last time
Are you holding on? Keep holding on
You're not like me

Your faceless lies
Your weak dead heart
Your black dead eyes

I'll break you in, and let this die
Your hope is gone
And so is mine

Live, fight
Crawl back inside
Sick, blind
Love left behind
And I won't live, your weak wicked lie
You pull me in, I'm one step behind

I'm becoming a monster, just like you
After it all you'll try to break me too
Falling forever, chasing dreams
I brought you to life so I can hear you scream

Live, fight
Crawl back inside
Sick, blind
Love left behind
And I won't live, your weak wicked lie
You pull me in, I'm one step behind

I'm one step behind
I'm one step behind
