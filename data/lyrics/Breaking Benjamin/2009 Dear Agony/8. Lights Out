I am done pretending
You have failed to find what's left
I will suck you dry again
Some are not worth saving
You are such a pretty mess
I will choke the life within

Now you want to take me down
As if I even care
I am the monster in your head
And I thought you'd learn by now
It seems you haven't yet
I am the venom in your skin
And now your life
Is broken

After the lights go out on you
After your worthless life is through
I will remember how you scream
I can't afford to care
I can't afford to care

I am suffocating
You have failed to pull me in
I will drag you down again
Life is unrelenting
Feeding lies into my head
I will feed the lies you live

Now you want to take me down
As if I even care
I am the monster in your head
And I thought you'd learn by now
It seems you haven't yet
I am the venom in your skin
And now your life
Is broken

After the lights go out on you
After your worthless life is through
I will remember how you scream
I can't afford to care
I can't afford to care

I can't afford to care
After the lights go out on you
After your worthless life is through
I will remember how you scream
I can't afford to care
I can't afford to care

I can't afford to care
