Slip away your vanity is gone
I'm falling out of place
We all fall down, the pain goes on
We bare the fruit of war
And turn the lost away
We all fall down, the pain goes on
And I'll be the fire that dries the flood

As I fight for one last prayer
I keep holding on
No love to believe in
As I drag the Devil down
I will stand alone
No longer defeated

Stripped away we rise above it all
Forgotten and betrayed
We all fall down, the pain goes on
No better than before
Still broken and afraid
We all fall down, the pain goes on
And I'll be the cloud that hides the sun

As I fight for one last prayer
I keep holding on
No love to believe in
As I drag the Devil down
I will stand alone
No longer defeated

I'm falling to pieces
Stained and used
I know what I need and it's not you
It's not you

As I fight for one last prayer
I keep holding on
No love to believe in
As I drag the Devil down
I will stand alone
No longer defeated
No longer defeated
No longer defeated
