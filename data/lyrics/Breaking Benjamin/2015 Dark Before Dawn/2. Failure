Life will come our way,
It has only just begun.
The world will die alone
The frail will fall below.

Time will take our place.
We return it back to one
The calm before the cold,
The long and lonely road.

Look for the light that leads me home.

Tired of feeling lost, tired of letting go.
Tear the whole world down, tear the whole world down.
Failure.

Drive the cloud away,
We will fall from last to none.
The dark before the dawn,
The world will carry on.

Look for the light that leads me home.

Tired of feeling lost, tired of letting go.
Tear the whole world down, tear the whole world down.
Tired of wasted breath, tired of nothing left.
Tear the whole world down, tear the whole world down.
Failure.

Tired of feeling lost, tired of letting go.
Tear the whole world down, tear the whole world down.
Tired of wasted breath, tired of nothing left.
Tear the whole world down, tear the whole world down.

We bury the sunlight, we bury the sunlight.
Failure! Failure.
We bury the sunlight, we bury the sunlight.
Failure! Failure.

Failure.
