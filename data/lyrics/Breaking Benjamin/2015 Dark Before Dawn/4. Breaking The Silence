I'll keep my sights on awaking dream
I gave my life to the vile beneath
I am but one of a dying breed
Hate kills this world, but it won't kill me

Wake up the victim of violence, shut the breath of the lifeless
I'm breaking the silence I'm falling apart for you
Wake up the victim of violence, shut the breath of the lifeless
I'm chasing the righteous becoming a part of you

Fake plastic life, full of wasted years
Love lost inside, diabolic fear
I feel no fault for the fault I feel
Hope drains this world, but it won't drain me

Wake up the victim of violence, shut the breath of the lifeless
I'm breaking the silence I'm falling apart for you
Wake up the victim of violence, shut the breath of the lifeless
I'm chasing the righteous becoming a part of you

Run

Wake up the victim of violence, shut the breath of the lifeless
I'm breaking the silence I'm falling apart for you
Wake up the victim of violence, shut the breath of the lifeless
I'm chasing the righteous becoming a part of you

I'm breaking the silence; I'm falling down with you
