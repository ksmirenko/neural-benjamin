Stay alive
Heaven holds a place for us tonight
I am paralyzed

Close your eyes
Drive away the cloud that hides the light
And leave the pain behind
Dead alive
Find a way to bury all the lies
Escape the pain inside
'cause I don't want to fall or let you go

Love left me hollow
I'm with you in the end
Cold, crippled and shallow
Don't leave me here again

Fruit of life
I can hear the voices of the hive
Chemicals collide
Loaded smile
Light the way for those you left behind
Set the earth on fire
'cause I don't want enough
I want it all

Love left me hollow
I'm with you in the end
Cold, crippled and shallow
Don't leave me here again
I can't go on
You are bound to break me in
I come undone
As you drag me down again

I come undone!

Love left me hollow
I'm with you in the end
Cold, crippled, and shallow
Don't leave me here again
I can't go on
You are bound to break me in
I come undone
As you drag me down again
