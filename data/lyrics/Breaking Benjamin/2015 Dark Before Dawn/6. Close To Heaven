Pain
Come alive
I try to breathe, shade my eyes
Follow the damned, I have lost the way again

Stay
Trust in life, carried beneath, dead arise
Sorrow avenged, I will face the weak within

So I'll stay unforgiven
And I'll keep love together
And I'll be yours forever
I'll sleep close to Heaven

Hate, lost inside
I dare to dream, faithless lies
Caught in the web, I will face the weak within

So I'll stay unforgiven
And I'll keep love together
And I'll be yours forever
I'll sleep close to Heaven

I'm coming home
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
Release me, my love

So I'll stay unforgiven
And I'll keep love together
And I'll be yours forever
I'll sleep close to Heaven

I'll sleep close to Heaven
I'll sleep close to Heaven
