I keep falling out of line
I was drained and left behind
All will fade and petrify
Feed the hate and starve the lies

Falling in between
I am caught beneath

Light the way and let me go
Suffocate inside
I will break and watch you crawl
Bury me alive

I keep falling out of time
I was blamed and cauterized
All will change and calcify
Feed the hate and starve the lies

Falling in between
I am caught beneath

Light the way and let me go
Suffocate inside
I will break and watch you crawl
Bury me alive

Control

Lies inside
Lies inside

Light the way and let me go
Suffocate inside
I will break and watch you crawl
Bury me alive

Light the way and let me go
Suffocate inside
I will break and watch you crawl
Bury me alive
Bury me alive
Bury me alive
