Carry me all through the night
I am the last light fading
Leave all the lost souls behind
Show me the silence breaking
And when you're lost and out of time
I will be right here waiting
And when your dreams return to life
I'll be forever fading
And we'll fall behind

So I'll wait for you
As I keep your faith alive
And I'll pray for you
As we cross the great divide

Bury the wounds deep inside
Rupture the fault line breaking
Dream of the world left behind
Show us we're worth forsaking
And when the cold begins to rise
Darkness is overtaking
And when the fear is satisfied
I'll be forever changing
As we all arise

So I'll wait for you
As I keep your faith alive
And I'll pray for you
As we cross the great divide
And I'll break for you
As I open up the sky
And I'll stay for you
As we cross the great divide

Follow the sunlight down
Cry clear and loud
Heaven won't help us now
But it's better this way
Warm light wash me away

So I'll wait for you
As I keep your faith alive
And I'll pray for you
As we cross the great divide
And I'll break for you
As I open up the sky
And I'll stay for you
As we cross the great divide
