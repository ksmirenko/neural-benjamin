They fall in line
One at a time
Ready to play
I can't see them anyway
No time to lose
We've got to move
Steady your helm
I am losing sight again

Fire your guns
It's time to run
Blow me away
I will stay, in the mess I made
After the fall
We'll shake it off
Show me the way

Only the strongest will survive
Lead me to heaven, when we die
I am the shadow on the wall
I'll be the one to save us all

There's nothing left
So save your breath
Lying in wait
Caught inside this tidal wave
Your cover's blown
No where to go
Holding your fate
Loaded I will walk alone

Fire your guns
It's time to run
Blow me away
I will stay, in the mess I made
After the fall
We'll shake it off
Show me the way

Only the strongest will survive
Lead me to heaven, when we die
I am the shadow on the wall
I'll be the one to save us all

You wanted it back
Don't make me mad!
Enough!
Die!

Only the strongest will survive
Lead me to heaven, when we die
I am the shadow on the wall
I'll be the one to save us all

save us all
