I feel you coming slow,
It seems that's all you know.
You come around never lie,
You sense it's all in line.
Deadened by the way you overwhelm,
Saved by the ways.
Dead and bothered by the breaking down,
Leave you all I have.
You might shove me down,
You will never be alone.
You can lock me out,
You will never be alone.
You can shove me down,
You will never be alone.
I don't know what you think,
You chose the silent way.
You look around you see,
It's just like all I believe.
Bothered by the part we end,
You will never leave again.
I'm a better part of you,
Dead if I can't make it out.
You might shove me down,
You will never be alone.
You can lock me out,
You will never be alone.
You can shove me down,
You will never be alone.
Your fucking way!
Bothered by the part we end,
You will never leave again.
I'm a better part of you,
It's all upon the end.
You can shove me down,
You will never be alone.
You can lock me out,
You will never be alone.
You can shove me down,
You will never be alone.
You can lock me out,
You will never be alone.
