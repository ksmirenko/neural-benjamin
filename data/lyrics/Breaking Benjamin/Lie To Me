No Named Bars
Dead end Stars
Empty roads to Nowhere
Unlocked cars
Life's so far
There's no here to get there

As fast as I Run
Could you catch me for once
Its the last time
I learn my lesson the hard way

Because you lost
Because I just love to hate you
Because you lost me

Cold and clean
Perfect dream
I don't have or want them
Hand me down
White washed town
Another boring anthem

As fast as I run
Could you catch me for once
Its the last time
I learn my lesson the hard way

Because you lost
Because I just love to hate you
Because you lost me

You lost
You lie to me
You lie
You lie to me
You lied
You lie to me

As fast as I run
Could you catch me for once
Its the last time
I learn my lesson the hard way

Because you lost
Because I just love to hate you
Because you lost me

You lost
Because I just love to hate you
Because you lost me
