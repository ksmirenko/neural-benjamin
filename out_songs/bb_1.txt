they fall in line
one at a time
ready to play
i can't see them anyway
no time to lose
we've got to make it through
you survive feganing

i'm on my way to better days
we't i har you're all is so lade that lead
i can't afford to care
i can't face the dark with the devil tonight
i'd say your weak peace
there's no way there's no place like home
i'm an ordinary man

ready to lose
the sun is nothing left behind
show me what's left
i'm on a me inside
well have me again
the fall behind
and i bend to place i stay alive inside
well that's not take the life from me
inside me

well how do you like that
i
