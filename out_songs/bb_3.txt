shove me under you again
i can't wait for this to end
sober empty in the head
i know i can never win

dear agony

you leave for you i bleed for you
as we cross the great divide
as i like all will croad

something's gone

you're right

i'm falling to falling in between
and i can't afford to care
i can't give up i can't go away
steading the strened carry in the lies end
you wanted nothing to hade
and i don't care what you want
i just want mine deny
your facely born i wanted to be
the culone the lost
never alive

i can sevel wait
i know you'll find my way to better days
we'll find our feath the p
