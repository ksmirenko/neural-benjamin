it's a crime you let it happen to me
nevermind i'll let it happen to you
out of mind forget it there fight again

i'm on a make it out alive
and when an w
what was away

failure
look what you did
suffocate inside

i don't care worthled
when you suffer in is i dan

so i'll stay for one last time
i know you will cover me
in's i fall in line
and i'll stay unforgiven

into the natural

only the part will rise
another take up i will try
than you're side us
this life has left forever

so get a your white sheven and bury i will try to end
you want mine
get up
force it
so save yourself this this tall
